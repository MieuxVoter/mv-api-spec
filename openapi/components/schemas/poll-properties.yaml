  type: string
  description: >
    A lengthy description of the poll.
    In here should be stated the constitutive details of the poll,
    whether it is informative or imperative for example.
  example: >
    This poll will help decide which projects get the most attention and budget
    so you should consider the proposals carefully and with gumption.
proposals:
  type: array
  description: >
    The proposals being judged by the participants of the poll.
    It makes no sense to have less than two proposals in a poll.
  minItems: 2
  maxItems: 20
  items:
    $ref: ./proposal.yaml
grades:
  type: array
  description: |
    The grades that participants may give to each proposal.
    The grades should be **non-ambiguously ordinal**,
    ie. their ranking should be obvious to everyone.

    #### Good examples
    - DISAPPROVED, APPROVED
    - TO REJECT, POOR, PASSABLE, GOOD, VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT
    - BORING, ENTERTAINING, FUN, AMAZING   (to be discussed)

    #### Bad examples
    - LOUSY, MEDIOCRE, OKAY, GOOD, FINE, PEACHY
    - BORING, BEAUTIFUL, FUN, MAGNIFICIENT
  minItems: 2
  maxItems: 10
  items:
    $ref: ./grade.yaml
participants:
  type: array
  description: |
    The participants that are allowed to participate in the poll.
    That property is ignored if `restrict_participants` is `false`.

    Or should this be the list of the participants of the poll?

    $ref: ./participant.yaml
user-id:
  type: string
  description: Organizer id. If not given, a dummy user is created.
restrict-participants:
  type: boolean
  description: True if anyone can participate in this poll, False otherwise.
