## What is this?

An _Application Programming Interface_ (API) for a polling application
using **Majority Judgment**.

You are looking at the specifications of the communication between server and clients, usually because you want to make your own client.

### Help, I'm lost!

Best head to the official application client, then:
[Application MieuxVoter](https://app.mieuxvoter.fr).
See you there !


## What is Majority Judgment?

We believe that it is the most elegant polling system that is available right now.

It was discovered in 2002 by 🇫🇷 french researchers, and it comes from 🍷 wine 🏆 contests.
